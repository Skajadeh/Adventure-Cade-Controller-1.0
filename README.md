# Adventure-Cade-Controller-1.0
Homebrew USB Game Controller for Raspberry Pi using a Teensy 3.1
This is the beginning of a project to create a USB Retro Game Controller for RetroPie. This code is a derivative from the example files downloaded from the PJRC.com website. Additions made to this code are examples of button macros that allow the player to execute complicated game maneuvers such as a Hadouken in Street Fighter with a single button press. Please enjoy and make some kick ass finishing moves in your code.
